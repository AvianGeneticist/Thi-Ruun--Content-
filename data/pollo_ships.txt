	description "When Yurliakaeon first came onto the scene, the only fighters used in Thi-Ruun space were either for combat or point defense. Quickly, a cargo fighter was commissioned by committee, leading to the Uyiti-Kalore. However, Pollo-Talia realized that the flexibility of the carriers could be further improved by offering a cheap, lightweight fighter that could transport work crews. This compact, lightweight fighter is the result of their research."
	description "Even though the ship is intended to have Thi-Ruun occupants, it is still built around its pilot."

	description `The Pollo-Talia (anglicized as "Old Rotation") Corporation is one of the oldest production companies in Thi-Ruun space, specializing in making well-designed transports for the common Thi-Ruun populous. The Tarlec-Pollo (or "Lesser Vortex") is their most popular ship; large enough to carry two standard units of Thi-Ruun individuals while still being cheap enough to be easily mass-producible. It dces require a larger crew than most human vessels, but is also reasonably well-armed in the event of a hostile encounter.`
