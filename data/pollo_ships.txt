	description `The Pollo-Talia (anglicized as "Old Rotation") Corporation is one of the oldest production companies in Thi-Ruun space, specializing in making well-designed transports for the common Thi-Ruun populous. The Tarlec-Pollo (or "Lesser Vortex") is their most popular ship; large enough to carry two standard units of Thi-Ruun individuals while still being cheap enough to be easily mass-producible. It dces require a larger crew than most human vessels, but is also reasonably well-armed in the event of a hostile encounter.`
