	description "Relac-Viule is a widespread competitor to Yurliakaeon, with their ships providing a number of niches over standard Thi-Ruun vessels. For starters, their ships are extremely fast for freighters of their size, and are built around extremely strong central spines that give them staggering hull integrity."
	description "The Val-Lorai is their light freighter option, offering substantial cargo space with exceptional mobility. This is, however, at the cost of weapon space such as that provided by Kalore-Illoca's ships, or the flexibility of carry bays provided by Yurliakaeon's ships."
