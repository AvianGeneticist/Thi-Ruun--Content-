	description `Though its name and design implies that it is created by Kalore-Illoca, this design was actually developed by committee, and is locally produced on many worlds. As a heavy cargo fighter, these ships are quite sluggish, but provide any fleet capable of carrying them a significant increase in cargo space.`
	description `As with all Thi-Ruun fighters, the ship is built around its pilot, making it virtually impossible to capture.`
