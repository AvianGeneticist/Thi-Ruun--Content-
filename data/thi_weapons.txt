	description "This bulky installation is designed to fire large salvos of unguided Pollo-Guli missiles at distant attackers. Though the turret turns somewhat slowly due to the bulk needed to launch salvos of missiles so rapidly, it cannot match the stabilizing power of a ship's entire mass, thus reducing the platform's accuracy."

	description "Alkro-Jaqu missiles were designed to reliably disable a target's shields over long range, allowing shorter-ranged craft to finish the job. In addition to their primary damage, they cause additional discharge over time, causing incredible suppressive power to build as more missiles hit their target."
